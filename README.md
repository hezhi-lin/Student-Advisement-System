Student Advisement System
==================================


 The goal of the project is to give students academic Advisement automatically for Computer Science Department of Southern University. I developed  and deployed it successfully. And it is maintained by a stuff of department. I spent two months on this project. It save thousands hour per year for students and faculty. Students and faculies from other deparments or universities can not use the system directly. But they may can modify on it to compatible their context.
